## Installation & Running

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher

### Running the Game
```bash
python3 tic_tac_toe.py
```

Or make it executable and run directly:
```bash
chmod +x tic_tac_toe.py
./tic_tac_toe.py
```

## Game Interface

The game displays a numbered grid:
```
   1   2   3
1    |   |  
  -----------
2    |   |  
  -----------
3    |   |  
```

Players enter coordinates as numbers (1-3 for both row and column).

## Example Gameplay

```
ðŸŽ® Welcome to Tic Tac Toe! ðŸŽ®
Enter moves as 'row col' (e.g., '1 2' for row 1, column 2)
Type 'quit' to exit the game

   1   2   3
1    |   |  
  -----------
2    |   |  
  -----------
3    |   |  

Player X, enter your move (row col): 1 1

- **Quit Game**: Type "quit", "exit", "q", or press Ctrl+C
- **Play Again**: After a game ends, choose 'y' to play again or 'n' to exit

## Code Structure

The game is implemented using object-oriented programming:

- **TicTacToe Class**: Main game logic and state management
- **Board Management**: 3x3 grid representation and display
- **Input Validation**: Ensures valid moves and handles errors
- **Win Detection**: Checks rows, columns, and diagonals
- **Game Loop**: Manages turn-based gameplay and replay functionality

## Error Handling

The game handles various error conditions:
- Invalid coordinate inputs
- Moves to occupied positions
- Out-of-range coordinates
- Non-numeric inputs
- Keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C)
